# Developing

So you want to help out? Great! Let's get you up and running:

```bash
yarn
yarn dev-server
```

## Writing a new component
Creating a new component (or subcomponent) consists of 2 parts:
1. Write the `interface.json` outline
2. Write your html/css/js implementation, for this provide `plop skeleton templates` to get you started, type the following command to start the interactive shell:

```bash
plop
```
Use the arrows to select the `hig_skeleton`, type your component name (ex: `component123`), next type the location where you would want your component directory to live (ex: `src/components/component123_parent`). This will generate a `html`, `scss` and `js` file in the directory you provided, in our example it would create:
```
src/components/component123_parent/component123/component123.html
src/components/component123_parent/component123/component123.scss
src/components/component123_parent/component123/component123.js
```

## Adding a new icon
To add a new svg icon to our stack, simply add the `svg` file to the [src/basics/icons/src](src/basics/icons/src) directory.
Next run the following command:
```bash
yarn build-icons
```
which will trigger our build script to create an updated release file in [src/basics/icons/release](src/basics/icons/release). The build script in itself simply does a `SVGO` optimize of the svg, and stores the optimized svg as a string in a key-value object in our release file, read more about the script here: [src/basics/icons/build/build.js](src/basics/icons/build/build.js).

# Visual Regression Tests

We use [Gemini](https://github.com/gemini-testing/gemini) with Sauce Labs to have a consistent browser to test against.

1. Create a local file called `.env` and contact someone on the `#orion-hig-web-dev` slack channel for credentials. You'll need a `SAUCE_USERNAME=xxxxx` and a `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=xxxxx`
1. Run the gemini tests and generate a report: `$ yarn gemini-report`
1. View the report: `$ open ./gemini-report/index.html`

## Adding a Test / Updating a Test Snapshot

1. Create your gemini test files: the HTML skeleton and actual test file at `dev/gemini/[your-component]-test.js`.
1. Run `yarn gemini-update` to generate the snapshot.
1. Commit the screenshot as part of your feature branch.
