# hig-interface

# DEPRECATION WARNING: this package is no longer getting updates. Use the component packages published in the @hig namespace, and browse their source at [`packages`](..).

The HIG interface provides a JSON config describing what methods are availble on each HIG component. It helps ensure that `hig-vanilla` and `hig-react` (and any alternate implementation of a HIG component) have feature parity.
